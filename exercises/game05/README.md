# _GAME05_ _GAMEPLAN!!_
----
### For game05 I would like to try and mimic the player functionality similar to that of Club Penguin :) 
### The types of features and aspects that I would like to implement will be as follows: 
* First I want to have the players move around so when the user clicks on a space on the ground, the player moves and then stops. 
* The players when selected will display their user name. 
* I want to build some physical "portals" where when a player enters it loads another scene with a game. 
* Additionally, I want to load a second scene where you have a game that is similar to the CardJitsu played in Club Penguin. This game had player cards that would battle based on their strengths. For my implementation of this type of game, I want to have players battle with each other when they collide. Above each player there will be a strength bar that can increase and decrease. Whoever has a higher initial strength wins and their strength increases by some amount and whoever loses decreases in strength. 
* Another game I'd like to try and get working is somewhat like a "Snake Game" where the player will be on a platform and will have to collect objects by using arrow keys to move to them. When the object is collected it adds it to the end of the object so it follows behind. The more objects are collected the longer the player gets and the faster the player moves. There is a set boundary in the plane and if the player hits the boundary or one of the "bomb" objects the player is ejected from the game and returns back to the main interactive scene.
