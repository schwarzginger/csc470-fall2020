# ***CSC 470 Final Project***
## The Final Quest

Gameplay Description: 
- The game starts out on a title screen with exciting adventure music playing in the background. From there you can choose to read the instructions or continue onto the character selection screen where you choose the player you would like to use for the entirety of the game.
- Once you've chosen your player its time for the adventure to begin. You are brought to the Enchanted Forest where you have to do certain tasks in order to move onto the next level. The tasks include finding a key, finding the wizards spellbook, and entering through the passage way. 
- At each task, you are given a secret message that you have to decode and save for later. 
- Once you enter the passage way, you are brought to the Dragon's castle which is protected by deadly fire balls and evil wizards. You must weave your way through the fire balls and avoid the evil wizard otherwise you health is going to decline. The goal of this level is to reach the treasure chest before your health reaches zero!
- Once you reach the chest, you have to input the secret message that you decoded. If you do it correctly, you have to solve one last puzzle before you can exit the game. 
- Most features in my game were focused on UI in order to tell the storyline.
